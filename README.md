# Averroes AI Case Study
## **Overview and Origin**
- Company Name: Averroes AI
- Founded: 2021[1,3]
- Founder:  Tareq Aljaber^2,3^
- Location: Headquartered in San Mateo CA, US^1,3^
- Funding: Privately held.  Backed by venture capital including Plug and Play Tech Center and Shorooq Partners.^17,18^

## **Business Activities**
Averroes AI is addressing these shortfalls in the traditional defect detection space:^12^ 
- Accuracy - finding the right sensitivity
- Flexibility - overhaul of models for detection environment or design changes
- Open - freedom from hardware or cloud restraints
- Need for domain experience - extensive technical knowledge to adjust parameters and algorithms

 Averroes AI focuses on three main segments of the visual inspection market: semiconductor defectivity,  assembly line quality control, and remote inspection.

 Averroes AI uses artificial intelligence to produce more accurate, faster, and efficient inspections than a manual human driven implementation while not requiring end user data science knowledge.^9^  The models are visual inspection platform agnostic without the need for hardware purchases and self learning enables exploration of new defect modes[^9,12].  In this way, Averroes AI challenges solutions from platform providers that do not provide learning capabilities and/or are tied to specific hardware.  Averroes AI is also cloud agnostic so it will work with any cloud provider or onsite.^8,12^  Some competitors in the field are Cognex, Keyence, KLA. Applied Materials, Omron Teledyne, and Landing AI.^3,4,6^

 Once the defects are known, Averroes AI takes it a step further and offers monitoring, analytic solutions, and APC controls.^10,11^  

 Averroes AI operates in the machine learning space; specifically machine learning from images or machine vision.  Hardware such as cameras, lenses lighting, and sensors are needed but software is where Averroes AI differentiates itself.  They develope the algorithms, libraries, and development tools.  Use of CNN AI models allow for defect identification, labeling, and pattern recognition.  Using RNN models allow for the element of time to be added and motion to be tracked.  Attention mechanisms allow for higher accuracy, transformers cut down on latency, and reinforcement learning allows the models to evolve and learn.  As CNN, RNN, edge computing, 3D vision, and combining of data from multiple sensors improve, so will the product and benefit to customers offering long term growth for Averroes AI.^13^   

## **Landscape**
Averroes AI competes in the defect classification space.  They use self-learning AI models to detect known and unknown manufacturing defects.  They are active in multiple industries including: Oil and Gas, Pharmaceutical, Electronics, Aerial Inspection, Food and Beverage, and Semiconductors.^8^

In 2018 the Defect Detection Market was valued at approximately 2.97 billion US dollars and has steadily risen to 3.45 billon US dollars in 2023.  Value is projected to reach a conservative 5.5 billion US dollars in 2032. This equates to a 5.33% yearly growth rate between 2024 and 2032.^5^

 The 5.5 billion USD value in 2032 comprises visual inspection, non destructive testing, and automated inspection Systems; all of with Averroes AI is targeting.

 S&S Insider is projecting a value of 6.7 billon USD in 2030.^6^

 While Markets and Markets is even more bullish with a projected value of 5.0 billion USD in 2026.^7^ 
 
 Growth is being driven by manufacturing companies looking to automated solutions to meet customer and regulator quality demands while minimizing operational costs.^5,7^  Not only can labor costs be reduced but time to detect can be reduced through real time monitoring and analytics.  Although manufacturing lines are a major source for growth, remote inspection is also seeing upward trends.^5^  Through the use of drones, remote or more expansive inspections (such as of panels in a solar farm) are being used to reduce maintenance costs and ensure worker safety.

## **Results**
Averroes AI is in startup mode but they have seen success with trials in the semiconductor industry increasing submicron defect detection, labor, and productivity.^10,12^  
```
"We've experienced a remarkable 40-60% increase in submicron defect detection. Averroes has saved us over 300 hours/month/app of labor and increased our productivity by more than 30% .
Automation Manager @ Semiconductor OEM"
```
Work in the food and beverage space has seen thruput gains.^14^  Difficult inspections in sub-sea pipelines^15^ and solar farms^16^ have been made shorter, more accurate, and less expensive.

 ## **Recommendations**
Averroes AI has an answer to addressing known defects, unknown defects, and monitoring them.  However, what companies really need to do is to isolate the bad material and stop the defect from occurring.  In the case of a new defect, the company needs to be able to tag the defect and find process commonalities.^19.20^  To do this, the defect data must combine with other data from the company such as MES, other inspections, electrical test, fault detection, and logistics data to find root cause and stop whatever is creating the defect.  Averroes AI should develop a way to connect with the company's existing data in an agnostic way just as it has with the cloud host and inspection tool.  Otherwise, the application is yet another stand alone program that makes it difficult to take the next step.
